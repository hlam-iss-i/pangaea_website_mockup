# Purpose
This is a Next.js application that represents a mock-up of the Pangaea website's home page. There are some elements that are not exactly one to one, but the core functionality should be the same between the live Pangaea site's home page and the mock-up's home page.

## Installation Instructions
### Prerequisites
1. To start, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed (https://nodejs.org/en). To install these prerequisites, download the file from the site and run the executable. To check if you installed everything correctly, run "node-v" and "npm -v" in a command terminal.
### Installation of Dependencies
2. Once Node.js and npm are installed, clone the repo to a location of your choosing.
3. In a command terminal, navigate to where the cloned repo is located and step into the pangaea_home_mockup folder ("cd pangaea_home_mockup").
4. Install the required packages by entering "npm install" into your command terminal.
### Running the web application 
5. Once all dependencies have been installed, you can run the web application by entering "npm run dev".
6. The web application can then be viewed by going to http://localhost:3000.
